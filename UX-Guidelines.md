# UX Guidelines

###### In this guide, you will learn about some of the basic principles and key elements of UX (User Experience). 
These are general guidelines for creating a positive user experience. 
The following guidelines are not listed in a chronological order of importance, as they are all equally important to create a smooth journey for the user. 
Some of these may apply more than others in certain circumstances and can be seen more as general, good practice.

This guide was initially created by [YuurinBee](https://www.behance.net/yuurinbee) (Formless Labs) and is subject to change.

## Section A: Creating an effective UX Workflow

###### For this section, the recommended steps are listed in a chronological order to follow.

1. ### :brain: Plan
> In the planning stage, you are deciding the key objectives for the user and mentally mapping out what the journey looks like. 
Planning could also be seen as brainstorming, where you are beginning to come up with ideas that you would like to see implemented.
What do you want the user to accomplish throughout this process? At this stage, ideas can be written down on paper or preferably stored somewhere that can easily be referenced.
Consider storing ideas somewhere safe online that is accessible at anytime, around the world, and which multiple parties can view. 
This will prevent a potential point of failure in the future, if only the designer has all of the ideas on their computer or notepad. 

2. ### :pencil: Design
> Create the concept draft (often referred to as a wireframe), based off of the ideas you have gathered and consolidated in the planning stage. 
This can either be the first iteration or latest iteration you are looking to improve.
In this stage, you are beginning to get a visual representation of the desired user journey.
There are great programs available that allow for designers and teams to collaborate on UX wireframes, flowcharts, and more.
One highly recommended program, which is free to use, is called [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (web application for UX/UI design).
The design stage can vary depending on many factors. It can include elements of user interface (UI) or be completely bare bones for backend and frontend developers to begin working on the functionality.

3. ### :microscope: Analyze
> At this stage, the objective is to analyze what you have created. Look for point of failures, areas for improvement, and ways to generally enhance the user experience. 
At later parts of this guide, there are general bits of advice to follow that you can apply in this stage. 
Some aspects to consider and review to further analyze include simplicity, consistency, contrasting elements, user feedback, and more.
Before the first iteration is released, it is not feasible to have user testing and feedback just yet. 
Though, once a minimum viable product (MVP) has been created and released, you are able to gather deeper market research data and user feedback to help see what areas need the most attention and improvement.

4. ### :handshake: Consense
> The fourth stage, Consense, is all about coming to an agreement or consensus with the latest implentations and changes.
This stage will be addressed differently, based on the different structures of projects, teams, and organizations.
It is a simple process, either approve or deny the suggestions in the previous stages.
If denied, then make adjustments and changes until there is a consensus with necessary parties.
When approved, then push the changes into production with Stage 5, Iteration. 

5. ### :wrench: Iterate
> This last stage is all about the execution of the proposed ideas and changes. 
The frontend and backend developers will make changes according to what was shared in previous stages.
The goal in this part of the process is to make sure the changes implemented are fully functional. 
Anything being broken or partially working, will likely result in a pain point and ultimately harm the user experience.

### :repeat: Repeat

> The workflow and steps will always remain the same. After releasing an MVP or first iteration, Steps 2, 3, 4, and 5 can all be repeated in the same order.
Every cycle that is completed should ideally be improving and enhancing the user experience, largely based on user feedback and market research data.
